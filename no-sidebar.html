												<p>
												Growing up along the picturesque banks of the Mississippi River in Minnesota, I developed an early fascination with the region's sandstone cliffs and clay formations. This connection to nature would become the foundation of my lifelong passion for environmental stewardship.
												</p>
												<p>
												I embarked on a transformative journey when I pursued my B.S. in Geology at the University of Washington in Washington State. It was here that I truly fell in love with the breathtaking public lands and the boundless beauty of the outdoors. Just days into orientation, I found myself backpacking through the majestic wilderness of Olympic National Park and studying the awe-inspiring glaciers of Mount Rainier (Tahoma). This exposure to the wonders of nature fueled my desire to explore and map foreign lands, leading me to embark on adventures across the American West, Iceland, and Spain.
												</p>
												<p>
												My experiences during those travels were deeply impactful. I was honored to receive the prestigious Lowther Award for my unwavering passion in merging fieldwork with laboratory studies. Eager to share my enthusiasm for Earth sciences, I played an instrumental role in creating the Earth Science Honor Society at my university, bringing together 32 like-minded students in a community of learning and exploration. My education culminated with a rigorous field camp in the Pyrenees of Spain and France, solidifying my commitment to understanding the Earth's intricacies.
												</p>
												<p>
												Following my time in academia, I discovered my true calling: teaching and inspiring others about the natural wonders found within the national parks. As a Wilderness and Search/Rescue Park Ranger in Yosemite, Mount Rainier, Olympic, and Sequoia National Parks, I had the privilege of engaging with visitors and students alike, fostering a deep connection to the land through immersive and data-driven experiences. My role also involved collaborating with private landowners and public agencies to promote sustainable land use practices, nurturing a sense of environmental responsibility in all my interactions.
												</p>
												<p>
												These experiences laid the groundwork for my next chapter: combining my passion for environmental stewardship and data-driven insights to contribute to a sustainable energy future. Pursuing a Master of Science in Information Management with a Data Science Specialization at the University of Washington, I honed my skills in applying machine learning algorithms to statistical econometrics. My focus on renewable energy and data science allowed me to develop robust forecasting models, empowering informed decision-making in the planning and development of clean energy projects.
												</p>
												<p>
												Fueled by a desire to have a more significant impact on the energy transition, I joined Morris Animal Foundation as a Database Associate on their Development Team. Here, I leveraged my expertise in geospatial analysis, cost modeling, and machine learning to establish a robust Power BI reporting infrastructure. Through data-informed decisions, we achieved remarkable outcomes in donor engagement, witnessing a 20% increase in donor retention, 15% growth in average gift size, and a 30% improvement in conversion rates. By automating processes using Power Automate and VBA enhancements, we streamlined data management, ensuring top-notch quality assurance and reducing manual workload by 40%.
												</p>
												<p>
												My journey from exploring the sandstone cliffs of the Mississippi to empowering data-driven decisions at Morris Animal Foundation has led me to realize that the most effective way to drive the energy transition is through the power of data science. With a strong educational foundation, hands-on experiences as a Park Ranger, and a keen passion for the environment, I am committed to contributing to a sustainable, clean energy future and making a lasting impact on our planet's well-being.

											  <h3>Hobbies and Passions</h3>
											  <p>
											    Imagine carving through the powdery slopes, the wind rushing past your face as you embrace the thrill of skiing. Or setting off on a daring bikepacking adventure, with nothing but a trusty bike and a sense of adventure to guide you through rugged terrains and breathtaking vistas.
											    <br><br>
											    If you seek an adrenaline rush, mountain biking offers the perfect escape. With heart-pounding descents and challenging trails, it's an exhilarating dance with nature. Not far behind is rock climbing, where you'll conquer towering cliffs, testing your strength and determination against gravity.
											    <br><br>
											    Fueling my adventurous spirit, trail running lets me explore hidden trails, escaping into the wilderness with every stride. Yet, even in the tranquility of home, I find joy in the art of cooking, concocting mouthwatering dishes that satisfy both heart and soul.
											    <br><br>
											    For moments of friendly competition, there's nothing like a game of tennis, where every swing brings anticipation and excitement. And during quiet evenings, I embrace the creative side of me through the rhythmic art of crocheting, weaving colorful tales with every stitch.
											    <br><br>
											    But when the day settles, and the world around me fades into the background, the realm of sci-fi books opens up infinite universes to explore. With each turn of the page, I journey through galaxies unknown, my imagination ignited by extraordinary tales of space and time.
											    <br><br>
											    These hobbies and passions fuel my zest for life, igniting a fire within me to embrace every moment with boundless energy and enthusiasm.
